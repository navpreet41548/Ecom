      "description":"The Air Jordan 4 Retro ‘Infrared’ features distinctive color blocking that recalls the ‘Green Glow’ AJ4 release from 2013. The upper is crafted from smooth nubuck in a charcoal finish. A lighter shade of grey distinguishes the forefoot overlay, while black accents land on the quarter panel netting, structural wings and Jumpman-branded heel tab. The sneaker’s titular hue lights up the woven tongue tag and a quartet of molded eyelets. A polyurethane midsole packs visible Air-sole cushioning in the heel for a smooth ride.",

Just as Tiffany & Co. is an iconic NYC brand, the beloved AF-1 silhouette—and its Triple Black colourway—was shaped by its time in NYC. Crafted with elevated touches like premium leather and finished with luxury detailing like the sterling silver piece on the heel, the AF-1 x Tiffany & Co. '1837' brings you instantly recognisable elegance and sophistication.

      "description":"In September 1985, Nike and MJ launched the Air Jordan 1. A month later, they were 'banned' by the league. Although the AJ1 is a sports and streetwear icon now, back when the sneakers debuted, they were highly disruptive and instantly revolutionary. While the league may have tried to stop MJ from lacing up in the original AJ1, they couldn't do anything to temper the fans, so 'They Can't Stop You From Wearing Them' became a defiant rallying cry. Now, the spirit of the sneaker is brought to life through the 'Rebellionaire' Air Jordan 1, which features that same not-so-subtle reminder printed all over the style's upper, and includes a Red 'X' mark on the heel to commemorate the birth of the banned legend.",

Crisp White stitching pops against premium Black suede, while Cactus Jack branding on the tongue and a beetle on the left heel (symbolizing progress, stability, love and nature) makes it a whole look. For those who do a double-take, the Swoosh is indeed backwards—it's a signature touch on all of Scott’s AJ1 designs. Pair 'em with the included bandana and your 'fit is officially complete. ",
